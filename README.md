## 📊 Smartwatch Data Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on smartwatch activity data, aimed at uncovering trends and insights about fitness and daily habits. The project was performed using Python and various data visualization libraries.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize smartwatch activity data to answer key questions such as:

•	How do activity levels vary across the week?

•	What is the relationship between steps and calories burned?

•	Which day of the week shows the highest activity levels?

The analysis provides actionable insights into daily fitness patterns, helping individuals better understand their physical activity.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit

It includes the following columns:

•	Total Steps: Number of steps taken each day.

•	Calories: Total calories burned.

•	Very Active, Fairly Active, and Lightly Active Minutes: Time spent at different activity levels.

•	Sedentary Minutes: Time spent inactive


## 🛠 Tools and Libraries
•	Python

•	Pandas for data manipulation

•	Matplotlib & Seaborn for static visualizations

•	Plotly for interactive visualizations

•	Jupyter Notebook for iterative development

## 📊 Key Insights
•	Activity Trends by Day of the Week:
Visualized how very active, fairly active, and lightly active minutes vary throughout the week.

•	Relationship Between Steps and Calories Burned:
Identified a positive correlation between steps and calories, with insights visualized through scatter plots and trendlines.

•	Activity Breakdown:
Explored the contributions of various activity levels (very active, fairly active, and lightly active) to the total active minutes.


## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes various types of charts, such as:

•	Bar charts to compare activity levels.

•	Pie charts to show activity contributions.

•	Scatter plots to explore relationships between metrics.

## 🧩 How to Use
Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Malakismail/Smartwatch-Data-Analysis.git
    cd Smartwatch-Data-Analysis
    
Install the required libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis:
jupyter notebook


## 📝 Future Work
Perform time-series analysis to study long-term activity trends.
Incorporate additional features such as heart rate or sleep data.
Use machine learning to predict calories burned based on activity levels.
